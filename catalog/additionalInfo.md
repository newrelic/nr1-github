# Using GitHub Personal Access Tokens

Integration with GitHub requires the user to create or use a private
access token as a one-time setup step. This GitHub personal access token
increases security, because it ensures each user can only see repositories
they have access to. New Relic will store that access token, but the user
can easily delete it from New Relic's storage at any time.

We recommend creating a dedicated personal access token for this application only,
and you should give that token `read only` permissions. See
[GitHub's doc on access tokens](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
for full instructions.

Personal access tokens are stored with New Relic One's `UserStorage`
APIs. `UserStorage` data is accessible only to the user account and `Nerdpack` which created it. The data is encrypted in transmission, but is not encrypted at rest (within the underlying database). Because of this, `UserStorage` data may be accessible to a New Relic employee via an administrative privilege in the platform.
